## 🔥 Overview

This paper has been **accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT 2025)**.

While mainstream Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods successfully transfer knowledge by aligning instance-level feature representations, they often neglect **category-level information** and the inherent **difficulty of individual samples**. To address these issues, we propose **PCKD**, a novel Preview-based Category Contrastive Learning method. 

Our framework enhances student learning through two core innovations:

- **Category Contrastive Learning:** It distills structural knowledge by modeling both instance-level feature correspondence and the relationships between instance features and category centers. This explicit optimization yields highly discriminative category centers and better classification accuracy.
- **Dynamic Preview Strategy:** Unlike existing methods that treat all samples equally or curriculum learning that simply drops hard samples, PCKD dynamically determines learning weights based on sample difficulty. It assigns a smaller weight to hard instances—acting as a "preview"—to gently and effectively guide the student's training.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCKD achieves state-of-the-art performance across several challenging datasets, including **CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and Pascal VOC**.

Given an input, the teacher provides a **preview signal**, which guides the student to learn category-aware representations.

The framework consists of:

- **Feature Alignment**
- **Category Contrastive Learning**
- **Preview-guided Optimization**
