## 🔥 Overview

This paper has been **accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT 2025)**.

We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that enhances student learning by modeling **category-level structures** rather than only instance-level alignment.

Our method introduces:

- **Category Contrastive Learning** to capture inter-class relationships  
- **Preview Strategy** to adaptively adjust learning based on sample difficulty  

This leads to more **discriminative representations** and improved generalization.

## 🚀 Method

<img src="./assets/framework.png">

Given an input, the teacher provides a **preview signal**, which guides the student to learn category-aware representations.

The framework consists of:

- **Feature Alignment**
- **Category Contrastive Learning**
- **Preview-guided Optimization**

## 🧩 Key Components

### 🔹 Category Contrastive Learning
- Align instance features with category centers  
- Improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability  

---

### 🔹 Preview Strategy
- Dynamically estimate sample difficulty  
- Assign adaptive learning weights  
- Improve training stability  

---

### 🔹 Unified Objective
- Knowledge Distillation Loss  
- Contrastive Loss  
- Preview-guided Weighting
